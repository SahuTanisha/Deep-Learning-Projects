# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM on IMDB Movie Reviews

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis project using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks! This repository contains the code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews, showcasing the power of LSTM models in natural language processing (NLP).

## Project Overview

In this project, we tackle sentiment analysis by leveraging the capabilities of LSTM networks. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, in this case, movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. The LSTM model is particularly effective in handling the sequential nature of text data, making it a popular choice for NLP tasks.

## Project Structure

- *Data Preprocessing*: Learn how to clean and prepare the IMDB movie reviews for analysis, including tokenization and padding.
- *Model Building*: Discover how to build and configure an LSTM model using a deep learning framework.
- *Training and Evaluation*: Understand the process of training the LSTM model on the preprocessed data and evaluating its performance on a test set.
